# CMB-Master
The preliminary code generates the Cosmic Microwave Background Angular Power Spectra. 
The code uses packages such as healpy, py3nj, astropy. Please ensure that you have these packages installed before running it.
As the master method uses masks from the CMB data to tackle the foreground residuals, you have to copy your CMB files to the same directory where you are running this script. 
Currently this code only generates the Master Data from the theoretical simulations. The Master data obtained from the input maps is under development.
Since github has a limit on file size, the input files are not included in this repository, You can download it from the PLANCK legacy archive or send an email at : saichaitanya16@iisertvm.ac.in
